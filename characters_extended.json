His life had been passed in the country, among peasants and servants, and the daughters of the petty nobility; he had known none of the great ladies of the capital. Piera was the first woman he had ever seen who was not a peasant, a servant, or a provincial lady. She was the first woman he had ever seen who was simply a woman."
